# Unofficial DeepL Translator API

This repository contains a Flask application that utilizes the DeepL translation service to translate text from one language to another. The application uses Selenium and undetected_chromedriver library to automate the translation process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Only1337/deepl-translator.git
   ```


2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install flask
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   The application will start running on `http://localhost:30`.

4. Make a POST request to the root endpoint with the following parameters:

   - `text`: The text you want to translate.
   - `input_lang` The text language.
   - `output_lang` The output language.

   Example using cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -d "text=Merhaba DÃ¼nya!&input_lang=tr&output_lang=en" http://localhost:30
   ```

   The response will be a JSON object containing the translated text.

## Example Response

Example response from server:

```json
{
   "success": "true",
   "translated": {
      "text": "Hello World!"
   }
}
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you can modify the following variables in the code to customize the translation:

- `input_lang`: The input language code. Change this to the appropriate language code (e.g., `"en"`, `"fr"`, `"es"`).
- `output_lang`: The output language code. Change this to the appropriate language code.
- `port`: The port on which the Flask application will run. Change this if necessary.
